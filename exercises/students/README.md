In this assignment, you will practice writing code relating to struct and ownership. Follow the code comments.
- Ensure you are not missing any shorthands possible we have discussed.
- Define methods means you call that using a `instance.fn()` approach.
- You can have regular functions to iterate over the vector and sorting (ascending or descending) reason.
- Make sure you follow best practices.
  - Minimize number of warnings, if possible to zero.
